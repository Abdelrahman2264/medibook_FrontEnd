# Notification Sounds

Place your notification sound file here.

## File Requirements:
- Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
- Recommended name: `notification.mp3`
- Keep file size reasonable (< 100KB recommended)

## Usage:
The notification card component will automatically play the sound when a notification is received.

If the sound file is not found, the component will gracefully handle the error and still display the notification.
